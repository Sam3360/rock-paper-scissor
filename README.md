Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
A simple and classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. Play against the computer in this interactive console-based game!

Features
Player vs. Computer: Test your luck and strategy against an AI opponent.

Console-Based: Play directly in your terminal or command prompt.

Continuous Play: Option to play multiple rounds until you decide to quit.

Clear Outcome: Clearly states if you win, lose, or tie each round.

Input Validation: Ensures you enter a valid choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

How It Works
The game uses Python's built-in random module to allow the computer to make its choice. The core logic then compares your choice against the computer's choice based on the traditional rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors to determine the winner of each round.

Requirements
Python 3.x (No external libraries required)

How to Run the Application
Save the Code:

Copy the entire Python code for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game into a file named rps_game.py (or any other name ending with .py).

Open Your Terminal/Command Prompt:

Navigate to the directory where you saved rps_game.py using the cd command.

Example (Windows): cd C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\my_games

Example (macOS/Linux): cd ~/Documents/my_games

Run the Script:

Execute the Python script using the command:

python rps_game.py

How to Play
When you run the script, you'll see a welcome message.

You will be prompted to "Choose rock, paper, or scissors:".

Type your choice (e.g., rock, paper, or scissors) and press Enter. The input is case-insensitive.

The game will then reveal both your choice and the computer's choice, and declare the winner of the round.

After each round, you'll be asked "Play again? (yes/no):". Type yes to play another round, or no to quit.

Possible Enhancements
Score Tracking: Keep track of the player's and computer's scores across multiple rounds.

Best-of-X Series: Implement a "best of 3" or "best of 5" series instead of endless rounds.

GUI: Create a graphical user interface using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy for a more visually appealing game.

AI Improvement: (Advanced) Implement a slightly smarter AI that learns from your patterns (though this can make it much more complex).

More Choices: Introduce additional elements like "Lizard" and "Spock" (from "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock").
